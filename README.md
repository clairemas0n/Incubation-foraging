### Foraging behaviour of incubating shy albatross from Albatross Island, 2013-2019
Code to clean data, run analysis, and create figures for Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis, and forthcoming publication.  

Code is ordered, #0 onwards. The end of each script creates data that is to be used in the next script. 

Data have been collected using GPS tags (date-time, lat, long) giving location estimates with high accuracy (<50 m).
